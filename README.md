This code performs sentiment analysis on women's clothing reviews using a fine-tuned BERT model. The dataset is preprocessed by cleaning, removing duplicates, and lemmatizing the review texts. Sentiment labels are generated based on rating scores and balanced using oversampling. The text data is tokenized using the BERT tokenizer and passed through a BERT-based classifier. The model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations include performance plots and word clouds for different sentiment categories. This repository is intended for academic and research purposes.
